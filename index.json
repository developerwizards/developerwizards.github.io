Imagine you have two algorithms that perform the same task, but one is noticeably faster than the other for large inputs. Big O Notation helps us understand why. It gives us a mathematical way to analyze an algorithm’s performance by focusing on the most significant factors that impact execution time. Rather than focusing on exact execution time, Big O looks at how performance scales as inputs grow.

Example Accessing an element in an array by its index, which takes the same time regardless of array size. def get_first_element(arr): return arr[0] Explanation The function above accesses the first element in a list. Regardless of how large the list grows, accessing the first element takes the same amount of time. Thus, it has a constant time complexity, O(1). O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity Definition In O(log n) complexity, the time required to run the algorithm increases logarithmically with the size of the input. This means that as the input size grows, the time taken increases slowly, in steps proportional to the logarithmic base (often base 2 for binary operations). Typically, if the algorithm reduces the problem size by half with each step, the base is 2 (resulting in log₂(n) complexity), as seen in binary search. However, if an algorithm divides the problem into k parts at each step, the base of the logarithm will be k i.e. O(logₖn). For example, if an algorithm splits the problem into three parts each time, the complexity would be O(log₃ n). Logarithmic time complexity is highly efficient for large inputs because the time required grows very slowly, making these algorithms ideal for cases where the problem size can be repeatedly reduced by a constant factor. Example Performing a binary search on a sorted array, where the array is halved in each step. def binary_search(arr, target): left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1 while left \u003c= right: mid = (left + right) // 2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] \u003c target: left = mid + 1 else: right = mid - 1 return -1 Explanation The binary search algorithm divides the list in half on each iteration, reducing the search space exponentially. This results in a logarithmic time complexity, O(log₂n). O(n) - Linear Time Complexity Definition The execution time grows proportionally with the input size. Example Finding the maximum element in an array by iterating through each item once. def find_max(arr): max_value = arr[0] for num in arr: if num \u003e max_value: max_value = num return max_value Explanation If you double the size of the array, the algorithm will take twice as long. O(n log n) - Log-Linear Time Complexity Definition A combination of linear and logarithmic growth, typically seen in efficient sorting algorithms. Example Sorting an array using Merge Sort, where the array is split and merged recursively. def merge_sort(arr): if len(arr) \u003c= 1: return arr mid = len(arr) // 2 left = merge_sort(arr[:mid]) right = merge_sort(arr[mid:]) return merge(left, right) def merge(left, right): result = [] while left and right: if left[0] \u003c right[0]: result.append(left.pop(0)) else: result.append(right.pop(0)) result.extend(left or right) return result Explanation Sorting algorithms like merge sort break the input into smaller parts (log n times) and then recombine (n operations). Hence, O(n log n) complexity results from n operations done log n times. O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity Definition Execution time grows proportionally to the square of the input size, often due to nested loops. Example Sorting an array using Bubble Sort, where every element is compared with others in nested loops. def bubble_sort(arr): n = len(arr) for i in range(n): for j in range(0, n-i-1): if arr[j] \u003e arr[j+1]: arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j] return arr Explanation Nested loops where each element is compared with every other element create this complexity, leading to quick growth with input size. O(2^n) - Exponential Time Complexity Definition Execution time doubles with each additional input, making it impractical for large inputs.
